# AK4-Nettverk2

This repository contains a python script to automatically configure Cisco routers and switches to the point where they can be accessed by SSH (so Ansible can do further configuration).
It also contains Ansible scripts to further configure Cisco routers and switches. The current Ansible files are set up to create a specific network, but should be easy to edit for other setups.
